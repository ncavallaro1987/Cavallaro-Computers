		<dt class="tipsdt">Backup your data!</dt>
			<dd class="tipsdd">Hard drives fail, memory cards get lost or damaged, and if you haven't taken the time to back up your data you could lose precious family photos or critical customer records. Set up a back up plan that meets your needs (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc.) and follow it! To be most effective, a backup should be stored seperately from originals to avoid data loss due to catastrophe. For the best chance of data recovery, take advantage of our <a href=.\services.html>premium data backup services!</a></dd>

			<dd class="tipsdd">ISPs (and some other utility providers) will end promotional rates without notice, typically after 12, 13, 18, or 24 months. Keep an eye on your bill. If you see your monthly cost suddenly rise, take a look at your provider's website. Chances are there is a similar promotion to what you previously had, and all you have to do is call and talk with them to get the current promotion added to your account!</dd>
		<dt class="tipsdt">Power down, or at least reboot your computer!</dt>
			<dd class="tipsdd">You need to rest every day to be at your best, and so does your computer. Some times programs don't close completely when they should, and over time your computer is forced to try to remember more and perform more actions simultaneously. Taking a few minutes to reboot will help clear these left over processes and allow your computer to run more smoothly.</dd>
		<dt class="tipsdt">Use a battery backup for desktops</dt>
			<dd class="tipsdd">Desktops don't have batteries like laptops do. If your location is prone to power failures or blown circuits, you can use an <a href=https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=uninterruptable+power+supply target="_blank">uninterruptable power supply</a> to provide time to save your work and shut down properly in the event of power loss.</dd>

			<dd class="tipsdd">Show around for prices. Many local stores inflate prices to cover the cost of storefronts and sales people. Websites such as <a href=http://www.newegg.com/ target="_blank">Newegg</a> can offer better deals. The drawback being you don't have access to local support if something doesnt work perfectly.</dd>
